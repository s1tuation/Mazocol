Website I made for a company during my Internship with them. It was made from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Here you will the HMTL documents with all the code for the layout of the website.
In the CSS folder you will find a CSS document with all the styling I made for the website. 
In the Img folder you will find all the images used within the site.
